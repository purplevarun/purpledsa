# PurpleDSA

Track your DSA interview prep. Sign in, check off problems as you solve them across NeetCode 150 and a curated Top Interview Questions set, and climb the leaderboard.

- ✅ NeetCode 150 problem coverage
- ✅ Top Interview Questions set
- ✅ Username/password auth using a Supabase-backed `user` table
- ✅ Leaderboard and progress tracking
- ✅ Minimal dark/light mode UI
- ✅ Designed to run on Vercel with Supabase Postgres

## Tech stack

- Vercel for hosting
- Supabase Postgres and client
- Vite + React for the app shell
- Custom credential auth using the Supabase `user` table

## What you need for Supabase

1. Create a new project at https://supabase.com
2. Go to Project Settings → Database
3. Copy the project URL and anon key
4. Add them to `.env.local` and your hosting provider's environment variables

## Required environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file from `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then fill in the values:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
```

The app also accepts `VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. If both naming styles are set, the `VITE_PUBLIC_*` values take precedence.

These `VITE_*` values are bundled into the browser app. Use only the public anon key, never a Supabase service-role key.

Use the exact same values in both places if you want local and production to share one database:

1. Local `.env.local`
2. Vercel project environment variables

If those values differ, local and production will point to different Supabase projects.

## Local development

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Create `.env.local`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

3. Start the app:

    ```bash
    ./run dev
    ```

4. Open the app and sign in.

## Supabase database setup

Create the required tables in the Supabase SQL editor.

Run the SQL in `supabase-schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor. It creates tables, indexes, grants, and RLS policies used by login and leaderboard queries.

## Vercel deployment

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Import it into Vercel.
3. Add these environment variables in Vercel:
    - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
    - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4. Deploy the app.

## Notes

- `.env.local` should never be committed.
- `.env.example` is the template for local setup.
- The Supabase SQL schema is in `supabase-schema.sql`.

## Useful scripts

```bash
npm install
./run dev
npm run build
```

## Problem data

Free DSA Essentials is PurpleDSA's own collection of 100 coding exercises across nine topic groups. The former Striver/A2Z sheet has been removed, including its paid practice and lesson-only links. The collection is available at `/sets/free-dsa-essentials`.

| Platform      | Exercises | Progress       |
| ------------- | --------: | -------------- |
| LeetCode      |        42 | Automatic sync |
| NeetCode      |         5 | Manual         |
| GeeksforGeeks |        15 | Manual         |
| SPOJ          |        11 | Manual         |
| CodeChef      |         7 | Manual         |
| Codeforces    |        10 | Manual         |
| CSES          |        10 | Manual         |

Only free submissions belong in the collection; a free account may be required. Premium courses, editorials, hints, and AI features are outside its scope. Settings lists the platform breakdown and links to filtered exercise lists. The master index contains only exercises in active coding sets; design sets are separate.

Access was audited on September 10, 2026 against LeetCode's public `paid_only` metadata, the GFG and Codeforces catalogs, CodeChef's practice API (judge enabled; login is the only reported submission restriction), NeetCode's free practice pages, and CSES task pages. Three unavailable CodeChef candidates were excluded. SPOJ uses its canonical classical problem URLs, but its browser-security challenge prevented automated live-page verification; no actual judge submissions were made during verification.

Keep problem codes stable when correcting names or URLs because saved progress uses those codes. GFG practice links must use the exact `/problems/<slug>/1` URL; never derive slugs from titles or substitute search URLs. Use a verified free equivalent for premium LeetCode questions, not merely `locked: false`. Platform buttons display supplied practice links or supported HLD articles with their actual website labels.

### LLD Judge Practice

The LLD sheet at `/sets/lld` contains 25 free judge-backed exercises across five groups: stateful APIs, caching and versioned state, bookings and transactions, services and editors, and concurrency. There are 24 LeetCode problems and [CodeZym's multithreaded hit counter](https://codezym.com/question/6-design-hit-counter-multithreaded). Each title and platform button opens the actual coding problem, and the platform filter separates the two judges. The old search-link prompts are no longer in the active catalog.

These exercises judge functional behavior, not OO design quality or a complete open-ended LLD interview. For example, LeetCode's parking exercise manages capacity by car type, and its ATM exercise handles banknote deposits and withdrawals, not card authentication. Hints follow those specific contracts. A free judge account is required to submit. CodeZym's counter has multithreaded Java tests and single-threaded Python tests; LeetCode's supported languages vary by problem, especially for concurrency. LeetCode progress can sync; mark the CodeZym exercise manually in PurpleDSA.

Access was reviewed on September 12, 2026 using [LeetCode's public catalog](https://leetcode.com/api/problems/all/) (`paid_only: false`) and [CodeZym's catalog](https://codezym.com/questionsApi/allQuestions) plus its [question metadata](https://codezym.com/questionsApi/question/6). CodeZym question 6 has `type: 0` and `isPrivate: false`; its public client allows signed-in free users to submit type-0 questions. **`isPrivate: false` alone does not mean free submissions**: type-1 problems such as parking lots, Splitwise, and elevators require premium and were excluded. LeetCode's premium bounded queue, file-system, and tic-tac-toe exercises were also excluded. No authenticated submissions were made during verification; access policies may change.

Matching LRU, LFU, and ATM records retain their existing IDs and progress codes. New exercises have UUIDs and their own codes; unrelated retired prompts are not reassigned, and historical database progress is not deleted. Tests pin the reviewed destinations and reject search links and CodeZym premium replacements.

### HLD Study Guides

The HLD sheet at `/sets/hld` contains 20 original study guides and architecture diagrams, 60 detailed design deep dives, 60 clarifying questions, and 120 answered review questions (60 core checks plus 60 deep-dive follow-ups). Each guide covers requirements, worked capacity estimates, API contracts, data models, request flows, explicit correctness invariants, trade-offs, failure recovery, actionable monitoring, security/privacy, and validation/rollout. There are 42 reading selections and 20 video selections (15 distinct videos). These are hypothetical interview designs, not claims about a company's actual traffic or internal architecture. Explanations and diagrams are original; external material is linked and attributed, not copied.

The new product scenarios are Amazon's e-commerce marketplace, Netflix video on demand, BookMyShow ticket booking, Instagram photo sharing, and Google Drive/Dropbox synchronization. Existing messaging, feed, ride-sharing, and video-sharing topics now display WhatsApp, Twitter/X, Uber, and YouTube names while keeping their stable IDs and progress codes. The five new records use UUIDs. Product aliases such as "Book My Show", "Ticketmaster", "OTT", and "Dropbox" work in topic search and global search; deep-dive titles are also indexed globally.

The reader supports mobile topic selection, keyboard-accessible tabs, expandable answers, and zoomable/downloadable diagrams. Link to `/sets/hld?guide=design-bookmyshow&section=deep-dives`; sections are `guide`, `architecture`, `deep-dives`, `review`, and `resources`. Deep Dives includes operations, monitoring responses, security, and validation. Review includes both original self-checks and the additional follow-ups. Mermaid runs in strict mode with native SVG text and loads on demand. The "studied" checkbox is self-reported, not an assessment or code submission; HLD remains separate from coding judges.

Readings include Hello Interview, GeeksforGeeks, Amazon Builders' Library, ByteByteGo, Stripe Engineering, and official PostgreSQL, Redis, Confluent, Elastic, Flink, H3, Apple, Google, TensorFlow, S3, and IETF documentation. References are scoped explicitly: Amazon's idempotency article explains a checkout mechanism; Ticketmaster is a companion for BookMyShow; Dropbox informs file synchronization; the Netflix video is a YouTube media-pipeline companion, not a Netflix-specific walkthrough. The food-delivery guide distinguishes restaurant coordination from Gopuff's warehouse model.

Existing resources were reviewed on September 10, 2026, and new selections on September 12. Paid Hello Interview cache/payment breakdowns remain excluded. Ticketmaster (`fhdPyoO6aXI`) and Dropbox (`_UZ1ngy-kOI`) video IDs were read from publisher metadata, alongside publicly readable walkthroughs. The local network blocks YouTube, so playback, captions, and regional availability were not tested. Companion videos are labeled as such. Tests enforce all-topic depth, direct destinations, aliases, and reviewed video mappings; they are not a live availability monitor.
